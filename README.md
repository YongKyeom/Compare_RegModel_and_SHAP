# Compare_RegressionModel_LM_RF_XGB

## Description
* Regression problem
* According to various variable combinations, Compare prediction error with (Lasso) Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost
* I used 3 variable combinations

## Script
* If you adjust X(independent variable) and Y(dependent variable), you revise 'VAR_LS' & 'TARGET_VAR'
* 'VISCOSITY' in the script means that I want to know property variable, main target variable.
So If you do not have vairable like 'VISCOSITY', you need to remove that
